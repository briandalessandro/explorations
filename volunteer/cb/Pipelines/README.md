This folder contains several notebooks that can execute reproducible pipelines on the data provided during the Summer 2019 DK-CrossBoundary partnership. Each notebook is commented to explain its own logic. This is a high level instruction on where to start.

To make training data, run "Make_Training_Data.ipynb" in its entirety. Please note that you may have to edit file folder locations.


To build a regressor or classifier, run "Model_Pipelines.ipynb." This has code to build and save a model. Again, pay attention to folder locations.

Once you have data and a model, one can apply them in two separate analysis notebooks, using "Price_Elasticity.ipynb" or 'Village_Profile.ipynb.'
